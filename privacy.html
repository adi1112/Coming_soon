    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="update-note"><strong>Effective:</strong> 6 November 2025 • <strong>Entity:</strong> Fern Technologies Ltd trading as “HiveReply” (“HiveReply”, “we”, “us”, “our”)</div>

    <div class="callout" role="note">
      This Privacy Policy explains how HiveReply handles personal information for (i) <strong>Agents</strong> (real-estate professionals and their staff who use our platform), (ii) <strong>End Customers</strong> (people who message those Agents about property and advice), and (iii) <strong>Visitors</strong> to our websites. It also explains our relationships with third-party providers we rely on to operate the service.
    </div>

    <h2 id="identity">0) Identity of the Controller</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Controller for Service Data:</strong> Fern Technologies Ltd trading as “HiveReply”.<br>
      <strong>Registered office:</strong> 17 Sheralee Place, Bucklands Beach, Auckland 2014, New Zealand.
 <br>
      <strong>Company/NZBN:</strong> 9429053126672 <br>
      <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:privacy@hivereply.com">privacy@hivereply.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      For Customer Content we process on behalf of Agents, we act as a <em>processor</em> (service provider).
    </p>

    <h2 id="scope">1) Scope & Roles</h2>
    <p>
      HiveReply provides an AI-powered communications and automation platform used primarily by real-estate Agents and agencies to receive, triage, and respond to messages across channels such as SMS, WhatsApp, email, and voice.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Controller / Processor roles.</strong> For data about an Agent’s account, billing, and platform telemetry, HiveReply acts as an <em>independent controller</em>. For messages and lead data that End Customers send to Agents via our platform, HiveReply generally acts as the Agent’s <em>processor</em> (or service provider/processor under applicable laws). Agents remain responsible for providing notices to, and obtaining consents from, their End Customers where required.</li>
      <li><strong>Territorial reach.</strong> We operate from New Zealand and process data globally with trusted providers under contractual safeguards, including the NZ Privacy Act 2020, GDPR/UK GDPR (where applicable), and US state laws such as California’s CCPA/CPRA.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="definitions">2) Key Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Agent</strong>: The real-estate professional/agency who is our customer and manages an account on HiveReply.</li>
      <li><strong>End Customer</strong>: An individual who communicates with the Agent (e.g., buyer, seller, tenant, landlord) via channels integrated with HiveReply.</li>
      <li><strong>Customer Content</strong>: Messages, files, leads, and other data processed on behalf of Agents about End Customers.</li>
      <li><strong>Service Data</strong>: Account, billing, configuration, logs, and analytics about how the platform is used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="collection">3) Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>3.1 From Agents (Controller: HiveReply)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Account details (name, agency, email, phone), authentication data, role and permissions.</li>
      <li>Billing details and payment metadata (via our payment processor).</li>
      <li>Telemetry and usage data (timestamps, feature flags, device/browser, IP, error logs) for reliability and security.</li>
      <li>KYC or identity documents where required for compliance (e.g., to enable messaging numbers); see <a href="#retention">Retention</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 From End Customers (Processor: HiveReply on behalf of the Agent)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Message content and metadata sent via integrated channels (e.g., WhatsApp, SMS, email) including names, phone numbers, email addresses.</li>
      <li>Lead and inquiry details, property preferences, appointment requests, language preferences.</li>
      <li>Optional attachments (e.g., images sent by the End Customer) where supported by the channel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.3 From Visitors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic cookies for session management and security; minimal analytics as described in <a href="#cookies">Cookies</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="sensitive-data">3.4 Special Categories & Sensitive Data</h3>
    <p>
      Our services are not designed to collect or process special-category data (e.g., health, biometric, racial or ethnic origin, precise geolocation, financial account numbers) about End Customers,
      except minimal identity information for Agent KYC where required. Agents must avoid sending such data via messaging channels unless strictly necessary and lawfully permitted.
    </p>

    <h2 id="lawful-basis">4) Purposes & Lawful Bases</h2>
    <p><strong>Purposes.</strong> We use data to: deliver and secure the platform; route and store messages; generate AI-assisted replies; detect abuse; provide support; bill and collect payment; and meet legal obligations.</p>
    <p><strong>Legal bases (GDPR/UK GDPR, where applicable).</strong> Contract (performing our agreement with Agents); legitimate interests (security, service improvement); consent (where an Agent requests we send optional communications); and legal obligations (compliance, record-keeping).</p>

    <h2 id="dpia">4A) Data Protection Impact Assessments & Records</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We perform <strong>DPIAs</strong> where features may present elevated risk to individuals (e.g., new large-scale profiling or novel AI uses).</li>
      <li>We maintain <strong>Records of Processing Activities</strong> (ROPA) for our controller and processor roles.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="ai">5) AI Processing & Automated Assistance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Agents may enable features that draft or generate replies, classify messages, extract lead details, or summarize conversations. These are <em>assistive</em> features; Agents control whether to send messages and can correct outputs.</li>
      <li><strong>No sale of personal data.</strong> We do not sell or “share” Customer Content for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li>
      <li><strong>Model training.</strong> We do not use Customer Content to train our own foundation models. Where third-party AI providers offer data-use controls, we configure them to avoid using Customer Content for provider training or improvements when such controls are available.</li>
      <li><strong>Human review.</strong> If you (Agent or End Customer) prefer human handling or wish to contest an automated output, contact <a href="mailto:privacy@hivereply.com">privacy@hivereply.com</a>. We support meaningful human oversight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="derived-data">5.1 Derived Data</h3>
    <p>
      We may generate limited “Derived Data” (e.g., classifications, lead scores, summaries) to assist Agents. Derived Data is used only to provide and improve the service for that Agent and is not sold or used for cross-customer profiling.
      Agents can request human review or corrections where outputs materially affect their workflows.
    </p>

    <h3 id="aggregates">5.2 Aggregated & Anonymised Data</h3>
    <p>
      We may create aggregated or anonymised statistics (e.g., uptime, feature adoption, generic usage trends).
      These aggregates do not identify individuals or specific End Customers and may be used to improve reliability,
      security, and product planning. We do not sell personal information.
    </p>

    <h2 id="sharing">6) Sharing & Disclosures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>With Agents/Agencies.</strong> End Customer messages and lead information are shared with the relevant Agent using HiveReply.</li>
      <li><strong>With service providers (sub-processors).</strong> We use vetted providers under contracts that impose confidentiality, security, and processing limitations. A current snapshot is below.</li>
      <li><strong>For legal reasons.</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, legal process, or to protect people, property, and our services.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers.</strong> If we undergo a merger, acquisition, or reorganization, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction with appropriate protections.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="employee-access">7.2 Workforce Access</h3>
    <p>
      Access to production data is strictly limited, logged, and reviewed periodically. All personnel with such access are subject to confidentiality obligations and security training.
    </p>

    <h3 id="auth">7.3 Authentication, 2FA & API Keys</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Password security:</strong> Agent passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms (no plain-text storage).</li>
      <li><strong>Two-factor authentication:</strong> Available for privileged/admin access and recommended for all accounts.</li>
      <li><strong>API keys & tokens:</strong> Encrypted at rest, scoped by least-privilege, rotated on suspicion of compromise, and never logged in clear text.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="apis">7.4 APIs, Webhooks & Integrations</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Webhook signing:</strong> Outbound webhooks are signed (e.g., HMAC) and include replay-protection headers.</li>
      <li><strong>Inbound callbacks:</strong> We verify source authenticity (e.g., shared secret/signature) and rate-limit abusive requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Payload minimization:</strong> We send only the fields required for the stated purpose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="logging">7.5 Observability, Redaction & Debugging</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Operational logs capture minimal metadata (timestamps, IDs, status codes) and exclude message bodies by default.</li>
      <li>Sensitive fields (tokens, credentials, KYC identifiers) are redacted at source.</li>
      <li>Temporary debug logs that might contain personal data are time-limited and access-controlled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="retention">8) Retention</h2>
    <p>We keep personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes set out above or as required by law. Agents can request custom retention configurations where feasible.</p>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Data Type</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Typical Retention</th></tr>

      <tr><td>Marketing Preferences</td><td>Opt-in communications</td><td>Until opt-out or account deletion</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h3 id="kyc-handling">8.1 Identity & KYC Documents</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Encrypted at rest in AWS S3 using server-side encryption (KMS). Access is restricted to a minimal set of personnel under least-privilege.</li>
      <li><strong>Region:</strong> Stored primarily in NZ/AU regions where feasible; otherwise closest available region with equivalent protections.</li>
      <li><strong>Use:</strong> Solely for number provisioning, fraud prevention, and regulatory compliance.</li>
      <li><strong>Retention:</strong> 12–24 months after account closure unless law requires longer. On deletion, data is removed from active systems and expires from backups on their normal rotation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="legal-hold">8.2 Legal Holds</h3>
    <p>
      If we receive a valid preservation notice or anticipate litigation, we may preserve relevant data beyond normal retention periods.
      Once a hold is lifted, standard deletion and backup expiration timelines resume.
    </p>

    <h2 id="transfers">9) International Transfers</h2>
    <p>We and our providers may process data in New Zealand, Australia, the EU/UK, the United States, and other locations. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards—such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (and UK Addendum), NZ/EU adequacy decisions where applicable, and robust contractual and technical protections.Where required, we enter into the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (and the UK Addendum) with our providers and apply technical/organisational measures appropriate to the risk.</p>

    <h2 id="cookies">10) Cookies &amp; Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      We use the following categories of cookies and similar technologies, consistent with these Privacy terms and our Terms of Service:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Essential</strong> — Required for sign-in and security (e.g., session/authentication, CSRF, rate limiting, load balancing, Cloudflare WAF/Turnstile). These cannot be switched off.</li>
      <li><strong>Preferences</strong> — Remember your choices (e.g., theme, language, UI density). Typically first-party cookies or <code>localStorage</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics</strong> — Privacy-respecting, aggregated measurement to improve reliability and UX. Where possible we use cookieless methods; if a cookie is used, it is first-party and time-limited.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing/Attribution (public site only)</strong> — Limited attribution on marketing pages to understand which campaigns lead to sign-ups. We do <u>not</u> use third-party advertising cookies for cross-site behavioural ads, and we do not sell or “share” personal information for such advertising.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Examples of first-party identifiers/storage we may set: <code>session</code> (login), <code>csrf_token</code> (form protection), <code>hr-theme</code> / <code>hr-density</code> (preferences, via localStorage). Third-party essential cookies may appear on hosted flows like payments (Stripe) or security (Cloudflare).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can manage cookies at the browser level (block/delete/limit). Blocking essential cookies will break parts of the site/app. For details, see our standalone <a href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Signals:</strong> “Do Not Track” adoption is inconsistent, so we don’t change behaviour based solely on DNT. We do not sell or “share” personal information for cross-context behavioural advertising. Where recognised, Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals on public pages are treated as an opt-out of any such “sale/share” (which we do not perform).
    </p>

    <h2 id="dr">10A) Backups &amp; Disaster Recovery</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Backups:</strong> Encrypted backups are maintained on a rolling schedule to support disaster recovery.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion propagation:</strong> When data is deleted from active systems, it is removed from backups upon expiry of the normal backup rotation period.</li>
      <li><strong>Targets:</strong> We aim for commercially reasonable RPO/RTO; details available under NDA for enterprise customers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="bc-uptime">10B) Business Continuity &amp; Uptime</h3>
    <p>
      We use multi-zone cloud infrastructure and CDN protections designed to minimise downtime. Planned maintenance windows are communicated in advance whenever feasible.
