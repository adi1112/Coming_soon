        <b>HiveReply</b> (“we”, “our”, or “us”) provides AI-powered messaging, automation, and lead management for real estate agents and agencies in New Zealand and globally. We are committed to privacy, transparency, and compliance with all relevant privacy laws including the New Zealand Privacy Act, the EU GDPR, UK DPA, and the CCPA (California) where applicable.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. What Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only what is needed to provide, improve, and secure our services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact details: phone, email, name (for agents and end customers)</li>
        <li>Messages, leads, and preferences: content sent via WhatsApp, SMS, Facebook Messenger, web, email, or our dashboard</li>
        <li>Profile/account info: for agents or agency users (login, usage, settings)</li>
        <li>Device/browser/IP address: for security, fraud prevention, analytics</li>
        <li>Cookie, consent, and communication preferences</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Data We Process on Behalf of Agents (End Customer Data)</h2>
      <p>
        When agents or agencies use HiveReply, we may process personal data about their leads, buyers, tenants, or other contacts (“end customers”). This may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Names, contact details, and messages sent through WhatsApp, SMS, Facebook Messenger, web, or email</li>
        <li>Inquiry details, property interests, preferences, viewing or callback requests</li>
        <li>Other data provided by the end customer to the agent via our service</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We process this information <b>solely for the purpose</b> of:
        <ul>
          <li>Delivering messaging, lead management, and AI automation to the agent</li>
          <li>Storing, transmitting, and organizing messages and leads securely between agents and their clients</li>
          <li>Enabling agents to respond, track, and follow up on inquiries</li>
        </ul>
        We do <b>not</b> use end customer data for our own marketing, profiling, or analytics, nor do we sell, rent, or otherwise monetize this data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Multichannel, AI, and Third-Party Providers</h2>
      <p>
        HiveReply processes and transmits data via multiple channels, platforms, and providers, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>WhatsApp, SMS, Facebook Messenger, and other messaging platforms</li>
        <li>Email, for notifications or lead forwarding</li>
        <li>Third-party AI services (OpenAI, Google, Meta) for automated replies, lead extraction, and message analysis</li>
        <li>Secure hosting, cloud storage, analytics, and payment processors (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS, Stripe, Google Analytics)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These third-party vendors may process and store data in New Zealand, Australia, the United States, the European Union, or other countries, always under strong contractual and technical safeguards. These platforms process data according to their own privacy policies; we select subprocessors who meet high standards of security and compliance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. AI and Automated Decisions</h2>
      <p>
        Some replies and actions may be generated or assisted by AI/automated systems. If you or your clients prefer a human review or correction, you may request it at any time by contacting us or your agent. We monitor and improve our AI systems to ensure accuracy and safety.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Agent and Agency Responsibilities</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
